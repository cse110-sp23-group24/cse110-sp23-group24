# Use Tailwind CSS for Rapid, Custom UI Development

## Context and Problem Statement

We need to decide on a CSS strategy that allows for quick development, flexibility, and ensures that the team can easily adapt to it. Which CSS framework or approach should we use to achieve these goals?

## Considered Options

* Tailwind CSS
* Bootstrap
* Vanilla CSS

## Decision Outcome

Chosen option: Tailwind CSS, as it best fits our needs for rapid development and customizability (details below).

### Consequences

* Good, because Tailwind CSS's utility-first approach allows for rapid, custom design development.
* Good, because it offers extensive customization options, providing us the flexibility to create a unique user interface.
* Good, because it integrates well with modern build tools and supports responsive design.
* Bad, because it can result in verbose HTML due to the number of utility classes used.

## Pros and Cons of the Options

### Tailwind CSS

Homepage: <https://tailwindcss.com/>

* Good, because it's utility-first, which allows for highly custom designs without leaving HTML.
* Good, because it's highly customizable, allowing us to adapt the design system to our specific needs.
* Good, because it offers responsive design out of the box.
* Bad, because the HTML can become verbose with many classes, which may affect readability.

### Bootstrap

Homepage: <https://getbootstrap.com/>

* Good, because it provides pre-designed components, which can speed up development for certain types of projects.
* Good, because it's widely used and well-documented, making it easier for new team members to understand and use.
* Bad, because it's less flexible for custom designs compared to Tailwind CSS, as it's based on predefined components.
* Bad, because overriding Bootstrap's styles to achieve a custom look can sometimes be challenging and require extra CSS.

### Vanilla CSS

* Good, because it does not require learning any new syntax or framework.
* Good, because it gives complete control over styles and layout.
* Bad, because it can be slower to develop with, especially for complex user interfaces.
* Bad, because it lacks the built-in utility classes, responsive design system, and other features provided by CSS frameworks like Tailwind CSS and Bootstrap.
