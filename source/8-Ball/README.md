### Gradient Background (*Implemented 4/23/2023*)
In magic-8-ball.css:
```
body {
    font-family: Arial, sans-serif;
    color: #fff;
    background: linear-gradient(45deg, red, blue, green);
    background-size: 750% 500%;
    animation: animate 15s ease infinite;
}

@keyframes animate {
    0%{
        background-position: 0 50%;
    }
    50%{
        background-position: 100% 50%;
    }
    100%{
        background-position: 0 50%;
    }
}
```
A background for for magic-8-ball.html is generated from a linear gradient at a 45 degree angle containing the colors red, blue, and green. This background is then resized and in practice only a portion of the background is showing. The animation is from this enlarged background by being shifted side to side creating the illusion that the colors are changing.
