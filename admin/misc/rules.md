## Primary Means of Communication and Expectations
The primary method of communication that was decided during the kickoff meeting was Discord, and Slack will be used to communicate with our TA. All members are required to respond within 24 hours on a weekday, and within 24 hours if pinged on a weekend. Discord and Slack notifications must be enabled.

## Scheduling Meetings
Meetings will be scheduled either via Discord or in person after class. During the kickoff meeting, it has been determined that the best time for everyone to meet in person was after lectures, so that will be a meet time if a meeting is necessary, and everyone will be notified if we will meet 24 hours prior to class. There will be a designated meeting notes taker at each meeting, and notes must be udpated onto the Github repository within 24 hours after the meeting.

## Conflict Resolution
If a conflict arises between team members or there is a complaint about workload, members must approach either Linda or Maanasa if the issue can not be resolved without assistance. If Linda or Maanasa is involved in the conflict, the team member should bring this up to the TA.

## Expectations of Faculty and GTAâ€™s
