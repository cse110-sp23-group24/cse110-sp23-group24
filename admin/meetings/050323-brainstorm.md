## Basic Working of the App
- All cards must be face down.
- User picks a card and/or inputs some information.
- Each card must have a different image. Sound effects will be added such as card flip noise. 
- Feedback given about User's Past, Present and Future based on chosen cards. 

## Competition We Might Potentially Face
- Other teams may come up with their own unique ways to predict future and it might end up being more entertaining and creative.
- Having just one feature may be a setback for us. Many teams might add multiple things to attract Users, assuming they work correctly. 
- Other teams could have a more visually pleasing aesthetic to their app.
- Other teams could have effects such as voice recognition, shaking to get reply, etc.

## User and their Expectations
- User must be excited for the results.
- Content must have both, good and bad things, but must mostly end on an upbeat note. 

## Planning for Starting Pitch
What is Needed:
- Statement of Purpose: **Sholehani**
